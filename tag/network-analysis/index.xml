      <title>Learning from the neighbors: The diffusion of state broadband policies in United States</title>
      <link>https://ryanyangwang.github.io/project/policy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project will examine how state broadband policies diffused among the states in the United States over the last 30-year period utilizing a network approach and a recently released dataset, the State Broadband Explorer curated by the Pew Charitable Trusts’s Broadband Initiates (2019). The 835 state broadband policies in the United States (until January 2021) have been categorized into six main themes: broadband programs, competition and regulation, definitions, funding and financing, infrastructure access and legislative intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate broadband policies diffusion in the United States at the state level. The existing policy literature has identified four types of diffusion mechanisms: (1) learning by the success (or failure) of policies in other adopting units; (2) competition with other geographical units (i.e., states) for resources; (3) conformity to mandates from higher jurisdictions (such as national governments or international organizations); and (4) emulation of other units perceived to be ideologically compatible. Drawing from the broader policy diffusion literature, the current study aims at presenting the very first examination of state broadband policy diffusion in the United States with a network approach. Specifically, we examine in which states are emerging as exemplars in specific thematic areas and what mechanisms are at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of employing the traditional approach of event history analysis in policy diffusion literature, this study adopts a network approach based on recent methodological developments. Our purposes in the present study are two-fold: (1) utilizing the netinf algorithm (Gomez-Rodriguez et al., 2012), we infer a latent network of broadband policy diffusion in the United States for the past 30 years. Simultaneously, it uses the centrality measure and community detection algorithm to identify the facilitators (and early adopters) of the diffusion. (2) Building on the latent network generated from the first part, we test the determinants of the observed patterns of diffusion with a multilevel and dynamic logistic model (with pairs of states as the unit of analysis). Specifically, the logistic model incorporates the nodal-level state characteristics including social-demographic factors (i.e., population), political and legislative factors (i.e., legislative control, state governors’ party, state political partisanship), economic factors (i.e., state GDP), as well as the geographical factors such as geographical proximity and contiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Translation as anti-propaganda weapon? An exploratory analysis of #TheGreatTranslationMovement on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://ryanyangwang.github.io/project/tgtm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chinese Communist Party, with its massive propaganda machine, has been disseminating pro-Russia and pro-Putin narrative to Chinese public even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine starting in late February 2022, due to their “no limit” partnership. Alongside the development of China’s aggressive diplomatic voice (the &amp;ldquo;wolf warrior&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot;), and nationalistic public opinion (the &amp;ldquo;little pink&amp;rdquo;) towards the United States and its ally, the majority of radical opinion climate in China towards the Russian invasion of Ukraine has mainly sided with Putin. Meanwhile, Chinese censorship has also effectively silenced the expression for the camp of pro-Ukraine or against the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocked by the Great Firewall, Chinese public has been isolated from outside information. And because of the language barrier, non-Chinese languages users are hard to access the public opinion formation within Chinese media environment. Since March 8th, 2022, a group of Chinese Internet anonymous dissents has started a decentralized &lt;em&gt;The Great Translation Movement&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TGTM_Official&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;@TGTM_Official&lt;/a&gt;), which aims at translating not just the pro-war messages promoted by Chinese state-affiliated media, but also the radical and hateful speech from the Putin supporters across Chinese social media platforms, from Chinese to multiple languages – or rather, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://thediplomat.com/2022/04/the-great-translation-movement-shines-a-spotlight-on-chinas-propaganda/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Diplomat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called, &amp;ldquo;the dark side of the Chinese internet&amp;rdquo; against Chinese president Xi Jinping’s &amp;ldquo;Telling China’s Story Well&amp;rdquo;. Additionally, by utilizing the hashtag #TheGreatTranslationMovement, the dissents also advocated for translation via crowdsourced efforts on Twitter. Since the online movement has extended the content beyond the Russia-Ukraine war, which include but not limited to COVID-19 pandemic, anti-US or anti-Japan sentiment, and etc. Nonetheless, the online movement is also facing some critics as translating and spreading hate speech might ignite the anti-Chinese sentiment, which might be led to the anti-Asian hate crime in countries like United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aims at providing an exploratory analysis of &lt;em&gt;#TheGreatTranslationMovement&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter. Since this is an ongoing data collection process, the preliminary analysis plans to focus on the English tweets with the hashtag #TheGreatTranslationMovement, via Twitter’s API 2.0 for Academic Research. The main goal for the exploratory analysis is two-folded: (1) what content has been translated in the movement so far; and (2) who on Twitter are participating in the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
