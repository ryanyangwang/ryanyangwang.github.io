The effect of BIP on the growth of farm sales was examined for the 2008‚Äì2010, 2008‚Äì2011, 2008‚Äì2012 and 2008‚Äì2013 periods. The selection bias (the probability that a county received BIP funding) was accounted for using the inverse probability weighting regression method (IPW). The findings suggest that BIP funding had a significant but short-term impact on per employment farm sales.","tags":["Internet access","Internet policy","Rural economics"],"title":"What $2.5 billion can buy: The effect of the Broadband Initiatives Program on farm productivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Bai","Ryan Y.

Utilizing the data obtained from the Zephry database for over 2500 M\u0026A cases involving U.S telecommunications companies, this study compares small and large blockbuster M\u0026As in several aspects and analyzes whether several factors that have been shown to influence valuation of large M\u0026As tend to affect small M\u0026As to the same extent. According to the regression analysis, those factors, including financial market dynamics, M\u0026A activity momentum, types of business expansion, and the involvement of foreign companies, influence the valuation of both small and large M\u0026As. However, the direction and magnitude of the influences are quite different among small M\u0026As.","tags":["Telecommunication industry","Media economics"],"title":"Drivers of Mergers and Acquisitions in the Telecommunication Industry: The Differences between Blockbuster and Small M\u0026As","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bumgi Min","Ryan Y.

Data were collected for 2797 arbitration cases filed during the 2001‚Äì2019 period from ten countries, five with US FTAs and five without. Logistic regression analysis, with controls for additional variables, found that complainants are less likely to win in FTA countries. The expectation from political economic theories predicting that FTA negotiations are used to obtain favorable legal environments for US businesses and individuals is not supported. This finding suggests that a more complicated and nuanced relationship exists between FTAs and UDRP decisions.","tags":["Internet policy","International economics"],"title":"Impact of free trade agreements on Internet domain name arbitration cases: A cross-national comparison of the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bumgi Min","Yang Bai","Ryan Y.

This study explores the role of news media consumption (local/national and traditional/digital) as predictors in voting in local and national elections, using a nationally representative data set from the Pew Research Center collected in 2016. Even though both types of news consumption are positive predictors of voting at both levels, local news consumption is more relevant when predicting local voting, and national news consumption when predicting national voting respectively. Moreover, the results indicate that traditional media are still a significant positive predictor of local voting while digital media are not. Neither traditional nor digital media platforms play a significant role in predicting national voting. The overall effect of news consumption on voting is more complicated and nuanced than hitherto discussed in the literature.","tags":["News consumption","Voting"],"title":"Voting in local and national elections: the role of local and national news consumption and news media preference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Y.

It aims to examine whether news media coverage is correlated with significant episodes of reform in the program. Using the ProQuest Major Dailies database, articles covering the \"Lifeline Program\" were analyzed. Specifically, a quantitative codebook was developed, based on the literature, and four coders were trained to systematically analyze the 124 articles that discussed the program between 1985 and 2018. The findings suggest that reforms in the program were preceded by significantly higher volumes of media coverage; however, the analysis is unable to confirm that negative media coverage has a stronger agenda setting effect. In addition, no significant difference was found between positive and negative news stories in their use of research-based information. This study is interdisciplinary in its ability to combine policy and journalism studies as a mechanism to understand the relationship between the two forces.","tags":["Internet access","Internet policy","News consumption"],"title":"From headline to lifeline: does news set agenda for policy?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
